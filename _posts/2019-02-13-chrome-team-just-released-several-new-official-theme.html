<p>I never use Chrome theme before, not a fan of customized theme because most of them are too stylish for me.</p>
<p>But Chrome team just released sever official themes days ago, they are clean and fresh, most of them seem for programmers. Like <code>Oceanic</code>, <code>High Contrast Colorful.</code></p>
<p>You can get them from here:&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/collection/chrome_themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <code class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="html"> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/collection/chrome_themes</code></a></p>
